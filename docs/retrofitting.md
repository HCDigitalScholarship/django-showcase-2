# Retrofitting existing repositories

## Documentation
The very first thing you should do is document how everything works as-is. You want to make sure you have a robust understanding of the current state of things before you embark on a big refactor.

Here are some questions your documentation should answer:

- How do new interns get set up with the project?
- How do you deploy your code to production?
- Do you have a test suite?
- If so, how do you run it?

Use the same file names as the documentation in this repository, i.e. `docs/setup.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/deployment.md` etc., and make sure to update the documentation as you move through the refactoring process.
